This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Important

Make sure to run the backend project as well, as the API won't work without it. Modify the api.js file with the appropriate backend route, using the API_URL variable. The default route is /api/v1.


## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).
